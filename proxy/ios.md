## Helpers

Let's be blunt - any proxy apps on the App Store are only for debugging, not for forwarding traffic to your corporate proxy servers.

Apps like `Charles iOS` or `Proxyman iOS` will only let you analyse your iOS network traffic; they don't solve any proxy connection issues :disappointed:.

So, in short, you're tied to the native proxy settings.
