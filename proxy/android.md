# <i class="i-android"></i> Android OS :id=android

There's no consistent way to set up proxies across all Android devices due to the various versions and customizations. However, here is a general example:

1. Open the Settings app.

1. Navigate to the Wi-Fi options and select your preferred Wi-Fi network.

1. Enter your proxy details.

?> On this particular phone, there were no authentication options. When connecting through the browser, it did request authentication credentials, but it's unclear if those credentials apply to all apps or just the browser.

## Helper apps

To be blunt - any proxy apps available on the Play Store are primarily for debugging purposes and not for forwarding traffic to corporate proxy servers.

They only allow you to analyse your phone's network traffic and do not solve proxy connection issues :disappointed:.

So, in short, you're tied to the native proxy settings.
